Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I'd like to learn about fragments and their implementations (can be possible because of the stretch stories)
2. Better way to take photos with the camera and resize them.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most challenging thing was implementing how to resize and compress the images and understanding that piece of code, as well as the code in the activity of taking a photo to compose a post.
